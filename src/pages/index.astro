            <p>At 15 years old, Brent was visiting his dad at Marion prison. When he was leaving the visit, he told himself, "No matter what happens in my life, I will never end up in a place like this." Thirty-two years later, Brent found himself standing at the gates of Leavenworth to serve a five-year federal sentence. <em>What happened?</em></p>

            <p>Brent became the CEO of the family's national company that was in the funeral, cemetery, and insurance business, Forever Enterprises. He along with his dad and brother were seen as innovators in their industry. Brent grew the funeral company from 3 states to operating over 20 states. The company was chronicled in the Wall Street Journal, TIME magazine, Entertainment Tonight to name a few. HBO even produced a documentary titled, "The Young and the Dead." Eventually, the company was brought down when Brent, his dad, and four others pled guilty to wire fraud, money laundering, and mail fraud. Brent had an additional charge of allowing an ex-felon to work in the business of insurance. Brent often speaks how risk and success can cause blind spots when growing a company.</p>

            <p>Once Brent returned home from prison, he authored the Amazon Best Selling book <em>Nightmare Success: Loyalty, Betrayal, Life Behind Bars, Adapting, And Finally Breaking Free: A Memoir.</em> He is the host of the popular podcast <em>Nightmare Success In and Out.</em> He has coined the phrase "Nightmare Success" because everything you want is on the other side of the unknowns and your fears. Brent is an engaging storyteller that has a real-life transformational story. Everyone has built up prisons in their own mind. Brent loves speaking to audiences about the 5 tools he used to survive his nightmare. These tools are excellent to use for your life and business!</p>

          <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For over 30 years, I have been teaching full- and part-time, and I can say that I have had very few guest speakers whose insights and life lessons resonated so profoundly with my students. Brent's presentation was unlike any other I have heard.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Brent spoke from the perspective of a successful businessperson who learned the lesson of taking ultimate responsibility. His presentation covered the elements of business leadership and emotional survival skills when your nightmare comes true. From his story, my students understood the level of reflection required when you face a point of decision.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Brent's lecture was compelling, and my students told me how much his life lessons could mean for their future professional undertakings. I recommended Brent speak at other venues, particularly where younger professionals can learn about the consequences of their decisions and where more experienced can reflect on their life lessons.

              As Brent Cassity stood at the gate of Leavenworth prison to voluntarily surrender his freedom for the next five years of his life, a million thoughts flooded through his mind. But, the one thought he couldn't push away is this: How did the thing I most feared, the one thing I told myself would never happen, happen to me?
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
              Nightmare Success is for the person who has lost hope, to show that a second chance is possible. Brent shares survival tools that helped him adapt to prison that can be used in everyday life for those who are stuck and fearful of continuing to step forward. There are business lessons shared about how to build a national company, and minefields to avoid.

                "Nightmare Success: Loyalty, Betrayal, Life Behind Bars, Adapting, and Finally Breaking Free is an astonishing memoir by Brent Cassity. In this book, Cassity explores the darkness of prison life and the lessons he learned there. He paints vivid and gut-wrenching scenes to describe the pain and humiliation of being searched, the brutality of prison life, and the feeling of utter desolation. What helped Cassity was his positive attitude and his will to survive despite the seemingly insurmountable odds. He talks of coping strategies and how his loyalty to his fellow inmates and his sense of justice kept him going. After years of hard work and dedication, he earned his freedom and went on to start a successful small business. His journey to success serves as an inspiring example of how courage and determination can help one overcome their darkest nightmares and achieve their dreams. Nightmare Success is a thought-provoking read. Cassity's storytelling will leave readers with an unforgettable account of his struggle for survival in the face of adversity. Highly recommended for fans of memoirs and crime dramas alike."

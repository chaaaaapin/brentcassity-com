## About Brent Cassity

Brent Cassity is an author, podcast host, and motivational speaker who helps people break down the mental prisons they've built for themselves. His unique perspective comes from personal experience: Brent was once a CEO of a national company who served a five-year federal sentence at Leavenworth prison.

### Background

At 15 years old, while visiting his father at Marion prison, Brent told himself: "No matter what happens in my life, I will never end up in a place like this." Thirty-two years later, he found himself standing at the gates of Leavenworth to serve a five-year federal sentence.

Brent had become CEO of Forever Enterprises, the family's national funeral, cemetery, and insurance business. He grew the company from 3 states to operating in over 20 states. The company gained national attention, being featured in:
- The Wall Street Journal
- TIME magazine
- Entertainment Tonight
- HBO documentary "The Young and the Dead"

Eventually, the company collapsed. Brent, his father, and four others pled guilty to wire fraud, money laundering, and mail fraud. Brent had an additional charge of allowing an ex-felon to work in the insurance business.

Today, Brent speaks about how risk and success can create blind spots when growing a company, and shares the survival tools that helped him adapt to prison—tools that can be applied to everyday life and business challenges.

### Book Description

As Brent Cassity stood at the gate of Leavenworth prison to voluntarily surrender his freedom for the next five years of his life, a million thoughts flooded through his mind. But the one thought he couldn't push away: How did the thing I most feared, the one thing I told myself would never happen, happen to me?

Nightmare Success is for anyone who has lost hope, showing that a second chance is possible. Brent shares survival tools that helped him adapt to prison—tools that can be used in everyday life for those who are stuck and fearful of moving forward. The book also contains business lessons about building a national company and minefields to avoid.

### The "Nightmare Success" Philosophy

Brent coined the phrase "Nightmare Success" because **everything you want is on the other side of fear**. The concept is about facing your worst nightmares and coming out stronger on the other side. It's about breaking down the mental prisons we all create for ourselves.

### Reader Reviews

"Nightmare Success is an astonishing memoir. Cassity explores the darkness of prison life and the lessons he learned there. He paints vivid and gut-wrenching scenes to describe the pain and humiliation of being searched, the brutality of prison life, and the feeling of utter desolation. What helped Cassity was his positive attitude and his will to survive despite the seemingly insurmountable odds. His journey to success serves as an inspiring example of how courage and determination can help one overcome their darkest nightmares and achieve their dreams. Highly recommended for fans of memoirs and crime dramas alike." — KMB, Verified Amazon Purchase
